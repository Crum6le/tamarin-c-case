# Tamarin C case

3D printable case for the [Tamarin C](https://github.com/stacksmashing/tamarin-c-hw).

!!!! TODO: PICTURE HERE !!!!

# Instructions / Recommendations

This case was tested with PETG on a Anycubic i3 Mega.

### Settings

* Layer Height: 0.15mm
* Wall Thickness: 0.8mm
* Top/Bottom Thickness: 0.8mm
* Infill: Gyroid 20% (does not matter, Not much infill with this Print)
* Print Speed: 60mm/s
* Top/Bottom Speed: 20mm/s
* Support: None  
* Build Plate Adhesion: Skirt (No Brim or Raft! Print has round edges wich may turn out bad)

These are the settings I used. They are probably not the best, but they worked for me.

### Assembly

To assemble the case you need to put the PCB in to the Bottom half, it helps to put the USB Micro ahead and push down the opposite side. Finally close the Case with the lid.
