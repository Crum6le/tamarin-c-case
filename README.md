# Instructions / Recommendations

This case was tested with PLA on a Prusa i3 MK2S.

### Assembly

To assemble the case, place the PCB into the bottom half. It helps to position the USB Micro end first and then gently press down the opposite side. Finally, close the case with the lid. The PCB should not need to be forced into placeâ€”it will fit easily if aligned correctly.
