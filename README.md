# Tamarin C case

3D printable case for the [Tamarin C](https://github.com/stacksmashing/tamarin-c-hw).

!!!! TODO: PICTURE HERE !!!!

# Instructions / Recommendations

This case was tested with PETG on a Prusa i3 MK2S.

### Settings
Tilting the print 15 degrees in x and y direction will create stronger walls and clear any warping problem that come with printing PETG. 

These are the settings I used. They are probably not the best, but they worked for me.

### Assembly

To assemble the case you need to put the PCB in to the Bottom half, it helps to put the USB Micro ahead and push down the opposite side. Finally close the Case with the lid.
