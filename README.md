# Instructions / Recommendations

This case was tested with PLA on a Prusa i3 MK2S.

### Assembly

To assemble the case you need to put the PCB in to the Bottom half, it helps to put the USB Micro ahead and push down the opposite side. Finally close the Case with the lid. The PCB should not be pressed into place it will fit easy if done right.
